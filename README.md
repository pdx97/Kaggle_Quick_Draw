# Kaggle_Quick_Draw:
"Quick, Draw!" was released as an experimental game to educate the public in a playful way about how AI works. The game prompts users to draw an image depicting a certain category, such as ”banana,” “table,” etc. The game generated more than 1B drawings, of which a subset was publicly released as the basis for this competition’s training set. That subset contains 50M drawings encompassing 340 label categories.
